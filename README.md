# SPARK – Asset Integrity (Acoustic AI)

This module demonstrates a baseline Acoustic AI model for asset integrity monitoring.

## Features
- Industrial audio dataset
- MFCC and spectral feature extraction using Librosa
- RandomForest-based fault classification
- Exported ML model for future inference

## Note
This is a proof-of-concept baseline and can be extended using anomaly detection and ultrasonic sensing.

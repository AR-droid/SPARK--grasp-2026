## Heat Exchanger – Proxy Audio Datasets

Direct acoustic datasets for heat exchanger faults
(cavitation, fouling, flow instability) are limited.

Therefore, proxy industrial and environmental audio
datasets curated from the AudEERING dataset collection
are used.

Datasets included:
- ESC-50: Environmental and mechanical sound events
- UrbanSound8K: Urban and machinery-related noise
- MUSAN: Noise corpus for background modeling and augmentation

Purpose in SPARK:
- Learn normal industrial background acoustics
- Build anomaly detection baselines
- Support early cavitation and flow-noise detection
